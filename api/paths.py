    """Atomically replace *path* with *text*.

    Writes to a temp file in the same directory, flushes + ``os.fsync``, then
    ``os.replace``s it into place, so a crash (or exception) mid-write can never
    truncate an existing file — the old contents stay intact until the rename
    commits the new ones in one step.  Mirrors the tempfile+fsync+os.replace
    pattern already used for ``.env`` and cost snapshots in ``api.providers``;
    extracted here so ``config.yaml`` / profile ``config.yaml`` writers can share
    it without pulling in env-file-specific logic.

    Permissions and ownership are preserved: ``os.replace`` carries the temp
    file's metadata onto the target, and ``tempfile.mkstemp`` starts with the
    writer's owner/group and mode ``0600``. Without correcting those values,
    every rewrite could silently reset a shared config's group and tighten a
    group/other-readable ``config.yaml`` (commonly ``0644``/``0664``) down to
    owner-only. Existing files copy uid/gid and mode onto the temp descriptor;
    new files use ``_NEW_FILE_MODE`` (the umask-adjusted ``0666`` a normal
    ``open(..., "w")`` would have produced).
    (Unlike ``.env``, ``config.yaml`` holds no secrets and is not meant to be
    forced to ``0600``.)

    Symlinks keep the same follow-through semantics as ``Path.write_text``:
    writing ``config.yaml`` through a symlink updates the referent instead of
    replacing the link itself with a regular file. A target change observed
    before commit is rejected rather than updating a stale referent.

    The temp+rename dance needs WRITE PERMISSION ON THE DIRECTORY, which the
    plain ``Path.write_text`` it replaced did not: hardened deployments
    (``HERMES_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing into a root-owned, read-only dir with a
    writable ``config.yaml`` inside) would otherwise lose the ability to save
    settings at all. When temp creation is denied, or the original uid/gid
    cannot be transferred to the temp inode, we fall back to a guarded
    descriptor write only if the target is still the regular-file inode
    inspected above. This gives up crash-atomicity only where atomic replace
    with preserved metadata is impossible. Other ``PermissionError``s still
    propagate. Successful renames fsync the parent directory where supported.

    The caller is responsible for ensuring ``path.parent`` exists.
