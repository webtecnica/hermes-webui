"""Regression for #4159 (salvage of PR #4224): clicking a session-search result
that matched on message CONTENT must jump to that message in the transcript and
flash it.

Two halves:

1. Backend — the content scan in ``_handle_sessions_search`` already locates the
   exact message that contains the query (it iterates ``sess.messages`` and
   ``break``s on the first hit). Until now the loop index was discarded; these
   tests pin the new ``match_message_idx`` field on content-typed results,
   indexed against the same raw ``sess.messages`` array the renderer stamps onto
   each row as ``msg-user-<rawIdx>`` / ``data-msg-idx``. Title matches must NOT
   carry ``match_message_idx`` (there's no message-level hit to jump to).

2. Frontend scope wiring — the jump helper ``_jumpToMessage`` is defined INSIDE
   ``static/outline.js``'s IIFE (the file ends ``})();``), so a bare
   ``_jumpToMessage(...)`` call from ``static/sessions.js`` is a different
   ``<script>`` scope and resolves to nothing — a silent no-op (the bug that
   sank the original #4224). These structural tests pin the fix: outline.js must
   expose the helper on ``window`` and the sessions.js search-click path must
   reach it via ``window._jumpToMessage`` (the cross-<script> handle), exactly
   like the sibling ``window._outlineJump`` export. They fail on master, where
   neither the export under that name nor the call site exists.
